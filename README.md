# streamly-posix

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/hasufell/streamly-posix.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hasufell/streamly-posix)

POSIX related streaming APIs.

## Motivation

Since upstream wants to stay cross-platform, this library provides
strictly POSIX only API.

## TODO

* [ ] Fd based streaming (some is in internal modules of streamly)
